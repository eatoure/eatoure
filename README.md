## Hi. This is Amadou and ChatGPT definitely wrote this


Welcome to my corner of the internet where I let an AI sidekick "help" me code. Some of these projects are fully made by me, nevertheless ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
Sometimes itâ€™s a lifesaver, sometimes itâ€™s that loud kid in class who blurts out the wrong answer with full confidence. Either way, here we are.

## What is this?
This repo is basically me and Copilot arguing in real-time. Think of it as:
- 40% useful suggestions  
- 40% wild hallucinations  
- 19.000009% me googling the exact same thing Copilot just confidently got wrong
- 0.000001% real, genuine code

---

## Why?
Because typing every line of code myself is overrated. Also, I like the thrill of not knowing whether the autocomplete will give me:
- A perfectly working function  
- Or a beautiful disaster that deletes my entire database  

---

## Should you inspire yourself with my work?
Absolutely. Or not. Honestly, I wouldnâ€™t. But if you want to witness the chaotic beauty of humanâ€“AI pair programming, knock yourself out. 
BUT, I also have some really cool, self-made stuff here. So in all seriousness. Yes. Knock yourself out.

## Disclaimer
If this repo fixes your bug or gives you inspiration, youâ€™re welcome.  
If it breaks your system, that was **ChatGPT and Copilotâ€™s idea, not mine**.
